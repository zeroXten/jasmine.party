She got stuck because she wasn't looking <br>where she was going. Oh dear. Unfortunately, both of her beautiful wings got broken when <br>she got stuck in the tree. Her friend helped her get out from the tree and they went to the <br>fairy doctor. The fairy got better and learned to look where she was going. The end.<br><br><img style="width: 530px; height: 556px;" alt="Fairy" src="fairy.png"></body></html>
